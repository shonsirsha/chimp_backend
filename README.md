# chimp_backend

Backend for CHIMP ü¶ß üß° üçä

## Before You Start

‚≠ê All JS commands should be ran inside the `root` directory.

‚≠ê After every `pull` (or the initial `clone`) to this repo, please run `npm install` (just in case some new module has been added) this is to make sure you have everything installed.

‚≠ê Please edit the **database detail/config and JWT secret** by creating a new file in the root db called `.env`. Just copy the format from `.sample.env` and change the `xxx` to your own detail. Feel free to change the JWT secret to anything, as it will work just fine (this secret is not going to be used in prod).

‚≠ê Database is included in the root folder called `chimp_db.sql`, feel free to restore/import it to your own machine/server. If you feel more comfortable creating one yourself (instead of importing), check out the file `db.text` included in the root folder.

## Running The Server

Run `npm run nodemon` or `npm run start` (please note that with the latter you have to restart your server if you do make changes in the file(s) to see effect).

Default hostname is `localhost`.

Default port is `5000`.

Default route to the REST API is `/api/`.

To make sure everything works normally, do a `GET` request to this endpoint `/api/dev` (full URL endpoint: `localhost:5000/api/dev`) - it should return JSON object `{"message": "Hello World!"}` with the http status of `200`.

## Available REST API Endpoints

### /api/dev

There are two types of endpoint, private and public.  
Private routes require JWT token to be sent as headers named `x-auth-token`. JWT token can be obtained by signing in or signing up.

1. `/` - `GET` **PUBLIC**
   If everything works normally, it should return A JSON object of `{"message": "Hello World!"}` with the http status of `200`.

### /api/admin

1. `/sign-up` - `POST` **PUBLIC**
   Upon successful request: returns JSON object `{message: "user registered", token: "randomJWTtoken"}` with the http status of `200`.  
   Upon failed request: returns an error object (JSON) with the http status of `400`.

### /api/auth

1. `/sign-in` - `POST` **PUBLIC**
   Upon successful request: returns JSON object `{message: "user logged in", token: "randomJWTtoken"}` with the http status of `200`.  
   Upon failed request: returns JSON object `{message: "Invalid credentials"}` with the http status of `400`.

### /api/user

1. `/` - `POST` **PRIVATE**
   Upon successful request: returns JSON object of the current logged in user (containing `user_uid`, and `email`) and a message `{user: userObject, message: "success"}, user_uid: "randomJWTtoken"}` with the http status of `200`.  
   Upon failed request: [Errors (#2)](#errors).

## General

Authentication method: JWT  
Database: PostgreSQL

## Errors

1. All non-invalid request errors (any error coming from the backend itself) such as: server error, query error, etc will result in http status of `500` with the message of `Server Error`.
2. Upon failed request other than `Server Error`, ALL **PRIVATE** routes will return a JSON object `{message: "Token is not valid"}` or `{message: "unauthorised/no token found"}` depending on the situation with the http status of `401`.
