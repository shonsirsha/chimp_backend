# chimp_backend

Backend for CHIMP ü¶ß üß° üçä

## Before You Start

‚≠ê All JS commands should be ran inside the `root` directory.

‚≠ê After every `pull` (or the initial `clone`) to this repo, please run `npm install` (just in case some new module has been added) this is to make sure you have everything installed.

‚≠ê Please edit the **database detail/config and JWT secret** by creating a new file in the root db called `.env`. Just copy the format from `.sample.env` and change the `xxx` to your own detail. Feel free to change the JWT secret to anything, as it will work just fine (this secret is not going to be used in prod).

‚≠ê Database file (.sql) `chimp_db.sql` is included in the root folder. Feel free to restore / import it to your own machine/server. If you feel more comfortable creating one yourself (instead of importing), check out the file `db.text` included in the root folder.

## Running The Server

Run `npm run nodemon` or `npm run start` (please note that with the latter you have to restart your server if you do make changes in the file(s) to see effect).

Default hostname is `localhost`.

Default port is `5000`.

Default route to the REST API is `/api/`.

To make sure everything works normally, do a `GET` request to this endpoint `/api/dev` (full URL endpoint: `localhost:5000/api/dev`) - it should return JSON object `{"msg": "Hello World!"}` with the http status of `200`.

## Available REST API Endpoints

There are two types of endpoint, private and public.  
**IMPORTANT: Private routes ALWAYS require JWT token to be sent as headers named `x-auth-token`.**  
**JWT token can be obtained by signing in or signing up** (JWT authentication method).

### /api/dev

1. `/` - `GET` **PUBLIC**  
   If everything works normally, it should return A JSON object of `{"msg": "Hello World!"}` with the http status of `200`.

### /api/admin

1. `/all-users` - `GET` **PUBLIC** (most likely to change in the future)  
   **Upon successful request:** returns an **array** of (JSON) user objects `[userObject0, userObject1]` where `userObject` contains `{id: someid, user_uid: "some user_uid", email: "mail@ex.com" }` with the http status of `200`.

   **Upon failed request:** returns an error object (JSON) with the http status of `400`.

### /api/auth

1. `/sign-up` - `POST` **PUBLIC**  
   **Send from your application (`Content-Type`: `application/JSON`):** a JSON object like this: `{email: "email@mail.com", password: "password"}`.

   <span id="signUpDV">**Data validation:**</span>

   1. `email` must be of correct format -> Error message: `email_fail`
   2. `password` must be at least 6 characters long -> Error message: `password_fail`

   **Upon successful request:** returns JSON object `{"msg": "user registered", token: "randomJWTtoken", user_uid: "some user_uid"}` with the http status of `200`.

   **Upon failed request:** returns one of the these with http status of `400`:

   1. `{"msg": "email_unavailable"}` - if email entered already exist in the db
   2. (if data validation is violated) Object containing array of error object(s) `{errors: [errorObject0, errorObject1]}` where `errorObject` has a property of `msg`.

   You can then work with `msg` if somehow your frontend validation still allows this violation(s).  
   The value of `msg` can be seen above on the sub-section <a href="#signUpDV">**Data Validation**</a>.

   The number of `errorObject` depends on how many data validation is violated.

2. `/sign-in` - `POST` **PUBLIC**  
   **Send from your application (`Content-Type`: `application/JSON`):** a JSON object like this: `{email: "email@mail.com", password: "password"}`

   1. `{"msg": "invalid_credentials"}` - when credentials does not exist in the db
   2. (if data validation is violated) Object containing array of error object(s) `{errors: [errorObject0, errorObject1]}` where `errorObject` has a property of `msg`.

   You can then work with `msg` if somehow your frontend validation still allows this violation(s).  
   The value of `msg` can be seen above on the sub-section <a href="#signInDV">**Data Validation**</a>.

   The number of `errorObject` depends on how many data validation is violated.

   **Upon failed request:** returns one of the these with http status of `400`:

   1. `{"msg": "invalid_credentials"}` - when `user_uid` does not exist in the db
   2. (if data validation is violated) Object containing array of error object(s) `{errors: [errorObject0, errorObject1]}` where `errorObject` has a property of `msg`.

   **Upon failed request:** returns one of the these with http status of `400`:
